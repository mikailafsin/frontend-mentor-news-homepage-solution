## My process

### Built with

-   HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I continued to improve my coding with Tailwind CSS.

**Some Tailwind css codes I use:**

```html
<div class="mb-8 lg:mb-0 lg:h-3/5">
    <img class="hidden w-full lg:block lg:h-full lg:object-cover" src="assets/images/image-web-3-desktop.jpg" alt="web 3 desktop" />
    <img class="w-full lg:hidden" src="assets/images/image-web-3-mobile.jpg" alt="web 3 mobile" />
</div>
```

### Continued development

I will focus on improving my knowledge of the Tailwind CSS in future projects.

### Useful resources

-   [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - This document page helped me to understand which class names the properties written in native css are written in tailwind css.
